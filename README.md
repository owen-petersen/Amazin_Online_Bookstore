# Amazin Online Bookstore

---
## Project Description
The project prototypes an online book store. The project goal is to gain experience with the Spring framework and use it to create a webapp with sufficient features. 

It aims to provide the following key features:
- Store owner can upload and edit book details and inventory
- Users can search and browse through the store's books and sort/filter based on specific book details like:
  - Author
  - Publisher
  - Publishing date
  - Genre
- Users can place books they are interested in into their cart (or remove them from the cart if needed) and proceed to checkout and purchase the books
  - The purchases will be simulated
  - Purchases will not exceed store inventory
- Users can view book recommendations based on past purchases
  - This will involve using the similar purchases of other users to recommend books that a user has not purchased
